## Development

### Spinning up the project

- Start minikube with `minikube start`
- Build & deploy services with `skaffold dev -f infra/skaffold.yaml`
  - If this fails with a missing `CrdbCluster` message, `kubectl apply` the missing CockroachDB manifests
- Expose the ingress on localhost with `minikube tunnel` (required on MacOS, otherwise just send requests to `minikube ip`)

### Connecting to the DB

- Start a client pod with `kubectl exec -it cockroachdb-client-secure -- ./cockroach sql --certs-dir=/cockroach/cockroach-certs --host=cockroachdb-public`
- Open a shell with `kubectl exec -it cockroachdb-client-secure -- ./cockroach sql --insecure --host=cockroachdb-public`
